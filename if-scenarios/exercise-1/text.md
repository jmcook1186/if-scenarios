To better understand the connection between manifest files, Impact Framework and the visualizer, we will regenerate the data you have seen in the visualizer from its manifest file.

On the right-hand side of this screen you have access to a terminal and a code editor. Impact framework is already installed, and you can find the right manifest file at the following path:

`./manifest-1.yaml`
