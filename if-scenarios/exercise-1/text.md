To better understand the connection between manifest files, Impact Framework and the visualizer, we will regenerate the data you have seen in the visualizer from its manifest file.

On the right-hand side of this screen you have access to a terminal and a code editor. Impact framework is already installed, and the right manifest file is saved at the following path:

`./manifest-1.yaml`


This file contains everything you need to compute the environmental impacts of this hypothetical website.

On the next page, we'll open the manifest file and explore its contents.
