In this exercise you will aggregate your `carbon` and `sci` values over time and across components.

You also have two files:

`boilerplate.yml` : this is a starter manifest file, ready for you to extend during the exercise.
`manifest-example.yml`: this is a completed example that you can refer to when you need to.

This is all you need to complete this exercise!
