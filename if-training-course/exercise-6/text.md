So far, your IMPs have only had a single element in the inputs array. However, many applications will actually track usage metrics over time. Therefore `inputs` will often be a time series. This exercise shows how to handle multiple timesteps.

You also have two files:

`boilerplate.yml` : this contains the IMP file you completed in the previous exercise, ready for you to extend.
`imp-example.yml`: this is a completed example that you can refer to when you need to.

This is all you need to complete this exercise!
