In this exercise we will build a manifest with multiple plugins. The aim is to observe how the outputs of one plugin become inputs to the next.

On the right hand panel you have terminal access to an environment with Impact Framework already installed. 

You also have two files:

`boilerplate.yml` : this contains the basic skeleton of a manifest file, ready for you to complete.
`manifest-example.yml`: this is a completed example that you can refer to when you need to.

This is all you need to complete this exercise!
