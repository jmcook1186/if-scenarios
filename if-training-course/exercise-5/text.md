In the previous exercise you created a complex pipeline for estimating carbon emissions. Here, you will turn that carbon estimate into an SCI score using a functional unit. The aim is to understand the relationship between carbon footprint and SCI.

On the right hand panel you have terminal access to an environment with Impact Framework already installed. 

You also have two files:

`boilerplate.yml` : this contains the manifest file you completed in the previous exercise, ready for you to extend.
`manifest-example.yml`: this is a completed example that you can refer to when you need to.

This is all you need to complete this exercise!
