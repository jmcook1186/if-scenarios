The SCI score is calculated as follows:

`SCI = (E*I + M) / R`

Where `E` is operational energy, `I` is carbon intensity, `M` is embodied carbon and `R` is the functional unit.

In the previous example, you did

`C = (E*I) + M`

So what remains is to determine a functional unit and divide your `carbon` value by it to yield SCI.
